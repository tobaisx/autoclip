"""Highlight detection — transcript in, ranked clips out.

The transcript is cut into overlapping windows so that long videos fit inside
small context windows, each window is scored by the configured provider, and the
resulting candidates are merged, deduplicated, boundary-refined, and ranked.

Overlap matters: a clip straddling a window edge would otherwise be seen only in
halves by both windows and proposed by neither. The overlap costs tokens and
buys back the clips that live on the seams.
